# Default initial "umask" value used by login(1) on non-PAM enabled systems.

# UMASK is also used by useradd(8) and newusers(8) to set the mode for new

# 022 is the default value, but 027, or even 077, could be considered
# for increased privacy. There is no One True Answer here: each sysadmin

# Only works if compiled with ENCRYPTMETHOD_SELECT defined:
# If set to SHA256, SHA256-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to SHA512, SHA512-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to BCRYPT, BCRYPT-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to YESCRYPT, YESCRYPT-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to DES, DES-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password (default)
# MD5 and DES should not be used for new hashes, see crypt(5) for recommendations.
#
# Note: If you use PAM, it is recommended to use a value consistent with

# Define the number of SHA rounds.
# With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute-force the password.
# However, more CPU resources will be needed to authenticate users if
# this value is increased.
#
# If not specified, the libc will choose the default number of rounds (5000),
# which is orders of magnitude too low for modern hardware.
# The values must be within the 1000-999999999 range.
# If only one of the MIN or MAX values is set, then this value will be used.
# If MIN > MAX, the highest value will be used.

# Define the number of BCRYPT rounds.
# With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute-force the password.
# However, more CPU resources will be needed to authenticate users if
# this value is increased.
#
# If not specified, 13 rounds will be attempted.

# Should login be allowed if we can't cd to the home directory?

DEFAULT_HOME	yes

#
# The pwck(8) utility emits a warning for any system account with a home

# Enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits
# (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is
# the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name.
#
# This also enables userdel(8) to remove user groups if no members exist.
#
USERGROUPS_ENAB yes

#
# If set to a non-zero number, the shadow utilities will make sure that
# groups never have more than this number of users on one line.

# group file).
#
# 0 is the default value and disables this feature.
#
#MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP	0
