# This file specifies additional parameters to kernel boot command line and
# initrd overlay images. Its content is set by the TuneD  bootloader plugin
# and sourced by the grub2-mkconfig (/etc/grub.d/00_tuned script).
#
# Please do not edit this file. Content of this file can be overwritten by
# switch of TuneD profile.
#
# If you need to add parameters to the kernel boot command line, create
# TuneD profile containing the following:
#
# [bootloader]
# cmdline = YOUR_ADDITIONAL_KERNEL_PARAMETERS
#
# Then switch to your newly created profile by:
#
# tuned-adm profile YOUR_NEW_PROFILE
#
# Your current grub2 config will be patched, but you can also
# regenerate it anytime by:
#
# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
#
# YOUR_ADDITIONAL_KERNEL_PARAMETERS will stay preserved.
#
# Similarly if you need to add initrd overlay image, create TuneD profile
# containing the following:
#
# [bootloader]
# initrd_add_img = INITRD_OVERLAY_IMAGE
#
# or to generate initrd overlay image from the directory:
#
# [bootloader]
# initrd_add_dir = INITRD_OVERLAY_DIRECTORY
